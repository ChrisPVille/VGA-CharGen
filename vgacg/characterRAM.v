/* characterRAM.v
 *
 * The character RAM stores ASCII characters and associated color/intensity
 * information for use by the video engine.  To allow easy interfacing with a
 * variety of systems, simple dual-ported RAM is inferred with an asynchronous
 * read port (read fall-through) for same-cycle access.  The use of asynchronous
 * ports excludes the use of block-ram, but allows use of single-cycle CPU
 * designs. This can be trivially modified for pipelined access (and thus block
 * ram inference).
 *
 * As this memory bridges the external (w_clk) and internal video clock domains
 * (the r_* ports), care normally has to be taken to avoid writing (from the cpu
 * domain) to an address being read by the video domain.  For Xilinx and Altera
 * parts, it is guaranteed that a read/write collision will not result in damage
 * or permanent corruption.  The read data may be corrupted, but the write will
 * succeed and subsequent reads will contain the desired value.
 *
 * That means there are two text update strategies:
 * 1. Update the text only during a vertical retrace (vBlank). This will prevent
 *     any visual artifacts from making it to the display (if a character
 *     happens to get overwritten mid-draw).
 * 2. Update the text at will, accepting there is a very small chance the given
 *     character is being drawn and the write will corrupt it. This corruption
 *     should resolve on the next video frame and is likely acceptable for most
 *     display projects.
